  			<h1>Synopsis</h1>
  			<p>When Jacob Portman was young, his grandfather, Abraham, told him that he had lived in a special orphanage for peculiar children run by Miss Peregrine.</p>
  			<p>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the debut novel by American author Ransom Riggs. It is a story of a boy who, following a horrific family tragedy, follows clues that take him to an abandoned orphanage on a Welsh island. The story is told through a combination of narrative and vernacular photographs from the personal archives of collectors listed by the author.</p>

  			<h1>Review</h1>
  			<p><h2>Pedro Picapiedra</h2> Burton’s latest baroque blockbuster is a greatest-hits hodgepodge, mashing together films like Groundhog Day, Harry Potter, Back To The Future, and the director’s own Big Fish and Beetlejuice.</p>
  			<p><h2>Morgan Freeman</h2> The title may read “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children,” but there can be no doubt for anyone buying a ticket: This is really Tim Burton’s Home for Peculiar Children. Not since “Sweeney Todd,” and before that all the way back to “Sleepy Hollow,” have the studios found such a perfect match of material for Hollywood’s most iconic auteur. It’s gotten to the point where the mere addition of Burton’s name to a movie title can justify an otherwise iffy prospect: You don’t want to see a “Planet of the Apes” remake? Well, how about a Tim Burton “Planet of the Apes” remake? Now you’re interested! Here, there’s nothing forced about the coupling of Ransom Riggs’ surprise best-seller with Burton’s playfully nonthreatening goth aesthetic and outsider sensibility, which should put the director back on the blockbuster charts.</p>
